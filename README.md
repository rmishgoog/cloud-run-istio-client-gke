#### Authenticate Cloud Run web applications to private GKE services with Istio Ingress Gateway (with mTLS) and Envoy

Serverless compute is awesome and it's extremely popular with developers who just want to write application code and prefer managed infrastructure as much as possible. Cloud Run (fully managed) on Google Cloud has been an instant hit among orgs who are looking at increasing the development velocity and    innovation at scale without having to go through the churn of provisioning, configuring and managing the infrastructure which is either a cumbersome job or create dependencies on other teams within the organization. Even further, these orgs are also fairly aware of keeping the "portability", "consistency" and "platform neutrality" of their applications intact and thus choose containers as a preferred mode of building, shipping and deploying the applications.

_Google Cloud Run checks all the boxes when it comes to having a compute option on cloud which is "container first", scalable, comes with zero infrastructure/netoworking/storage management and build completely on top of open standards like k-native and kubernetes. Now, that's all good, but as a matter of fact, Kubernetes has sort of evolved into the defacto starndard of building "cloud native" infrastructure and been around us for a while, much before the likes of Cloud Run or k-native in general were popular, organizations who bet heavily on kubernetes, have built enterprise grade APIs, served via microservices type modern applications, running on kubernetes. As these organizations get introduced to serverless compute platforms like Cloud Run, they often want to adopt them for releasing their differentiating user experiences faster but to hydrate these experiences with data, they need to access the services and APIs they have been running on kubernetes (in this case assume it's the GKE or Google Kubernetes Engine). But, Cloud Run being managed and run completely by Google Cloud, how can these orgs ensure that shiny/new web apps are accessung GKE services in a private and secure manner? Thant is:_

1. _All of the service to service communication is authenticated with proper RBAC applied._
2. _All of the service to service communication is kept on private network to further boost the security posture._

_In this tutorial we will go through a similar scenario where an enterprise is looking to innvoate through web applications or APIs deployed quickly and without much friction from infrastructure management side but yet can re-use the data and functionality available as enterprise services hosted on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), they must connect their web based public APIs or applications securely and privately to the GKE hosted services, as the norm suggests. While one can think of using an API gateway, but this enterprise has ruled it out because they prefer to expose only coarse grained "business functions" through API gateway and not granular data services which were not made to be available publicly or outside the cluster._
